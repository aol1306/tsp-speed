# TSP speed

TSP brute force algorithm implemented in Python, Cython, Go, Rust, C++ and C#.

Algorithm generates all possible permutations of given coordinate set and calculates path length. Finds best path in n! time.

Please note there might be some optimizations I didn't know about / didn't care to implement.

## Results

Tests run using i7-8700 @ 3.20GHz, Win 10.

I had one case where Cython implementation ran for 26.93s with the same data, no idea what happened.

C++ built in VS2019 - Release mode.

## Running

* Python: `python main.py ../coords.txt`
* Cython: `python main.py ../coords.txt`
* Go: `go run main.go ../coords.txt`
* Rust: `cargo run --release -- ../coords.txt`
* C++: `TSP.exe ../coords.txt`
* C#: `dotnet tsp-speed.dll ../coords.txt`
* Kotlin: `java -jar tsp.jar ../coords.txt`

You can also run all programs using run.bat script.

## Cython notes

Repo includes Cython extention built for Windows.

To build for a different system, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
